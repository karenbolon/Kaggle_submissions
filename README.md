**Space Titanic**

Similar to the previous Kaggle dataset of the original Titanic, Kaggle has created a new futuristic Space Titanic.  The goal is to predict which passengers will be correctly transported to their respective destinations.  

I tried Random Forest Regression Model with cross validation, Support Vector Model, and Logistic Regression Model.  I found the Random Forest Regressor Model had the highest accuracy score and used this for the sumbmission.

I obtained an accuracy score of 0.79307 on the test data.
